# 💗 For Her — A Little Website for a Big Feeling

It’s a *digital love letter*, a *confession page*, a *pixel-heart explosion*,  
and basically my attempt at saying:

> **“I really, really like you.  
> Like… girlfriend-level like you.”**

So I built a website for it!!

## ✨ What This Website Is

This site is a cute, animated, slightly dramatic (but in a good way) page I built to confess my feelings to someone very special.  
You know who you are.  
And if you're reading this… hi. 👀

It includes:

- Soft animations  
- Floating hearts  
- Pixel art vibes  
- A heartfelt message  
- And a VERY important question

- And a LOT of feelings ❤️

## 🚀 Why I Built This

Because some feelings deserve more than a text message.  
Some deserve a whole website.

## 🧸 Final Notes

If you stumbled here by accident,  
well… now you know I’m down bad enough to deploy to GitHub Pages.
